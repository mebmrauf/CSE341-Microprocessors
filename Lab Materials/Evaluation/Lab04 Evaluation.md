# CSE341 : LAB04 Evaluation

## Question 01

Write an assembly program which creates an array of length 5. The program should take all the elements of the array as inputs from the user. Then it should find the sum of all the even elements of the array and print the result in the console. [All the input numbers will be single digit but the summation might be both single or double digit]

Sample Input:

12345

Sample Output:

6

## Question 02

Write an assembly program that checks whether a character exists in a character array or not using procedure. You can declare and initialize the array inside your code, but the value to check must be taken as an input from the user. If the procedure finds the desired character it will print "Character found x time(s)" in the console where x is the number of times the character is present in the array, and "Character not found" otherwise.

Sample Input:

h // initialized array: bahai

Sample Output:

Character found 1 time(s)
