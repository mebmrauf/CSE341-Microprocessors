# CSE341 : LAB Evaluation 01
## SET - A

### Question 1 
An employee receives a monthly salary S. At the end of the year, they receive a bonus B% of their total yearly salary. Compute the total earnings in one year including the bonus. You have to declare S and B as variables and store the earnings in another variable Total(integer). 

Here, S = first 4 digit of your id & B = last digit of your id.

Example: If your id is 10002347, S = 1000 tk and B = 7%, total earning in one year = 12840.

### Question 2 
Perform the following operation : 
```
Total = dividend/X
X = (A+B*C-D)
```
Take 5 variables as **divident, A, B, C, D** and store it in a variable **(Total)**. If **"X"** is any negative value, convert it to positive one and calculate **Total**.

Here, A = first 2 digit, B = second 2 digit, C = third 2 digit, D = last 2 digit & dividend = first 4 digit.

Example: If your id is 10002347, A = 10, B = 00, C = 23, D = 47, div = 1000,

After calculating, Quotient = 27 & Remainder = 1.
